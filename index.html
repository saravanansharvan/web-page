            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>Perfume is a fragrant liquid used to give a pleasant scent to the body, clothing, and even the air. It's a mixture of essential oils, fixatives, and alcohol, designed to create a lasting and enjoyable fragrance. Perfumes are often used to express individuality and add a touch of sophistication to one's personal style. </p>

                <p>There is a controversy on whether perfumery was completely lost in Western Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire. That said, the art of perfumery in Western Europe was reinvigorated after the Islamic invasion of Spain and Southern Italy in 711 and 827. The Islamic-controlled cities of Spain (Al-Andalus) became major producers of perfumes that were traded throughout the Old World. Like in the ancient world, Andalusians used fragrance in devotion to God.</p>
